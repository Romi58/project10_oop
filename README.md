## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with TypeScript

### Overview
This project aims to demonstrate fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using TypeScript. It includes basic implementations of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

### Features
- **Classes**: Implementation of classes to represent real-world entities.
- **Inheritance**: Utilization of inheritance to establish hierarchical relationships.
- **Encapsulation**: Demonstration of encapsulation through access modifiers.
- **Polymorphism**: Examples of polymorphic behavior using method overriding.

### Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: Primary language for implementing OOP concepts.
- **Node.js**: Environment for executing TypeScript code.

### Structure
- **`src/`**: Contains TypeScript files for various OOP concepts.
- **`index.ts`**: Entry point for demonstrating the implemented concepts.
- **`README.md`**: Instructions for setting up and running the project.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/oop-typescript.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd oop-typescript
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Compile TypeScript files:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. Run the project:
